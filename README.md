# Stock-price-predictor
Its a predictor price model in which it will predict the direction of the price of a product, and for that I predicted the price of gold obtaining the data from
**Yahoo Finance**
## **Results**
I implemented the model with two different approaches, **Linear Regression** and two regularization techniques: **Lasso and Ridge Regression**. Accuracy is:
- In Linear Regression: 99%
- In Lasso Regression: 99%
- In Ridge Regression: 99%

So in this case all of the three scored the same accuracy
